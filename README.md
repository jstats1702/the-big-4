This repository contains all the necessary code to reproduce the results presented in the paper *Peace Sells, But Whose Songs Connect? Bayesian Multilayer Network Analysis of the Big 4 of Thrash Metal*.

If needed, these files are also available at [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ghi6keeu73j1zis47t0lc/ALIuYZj3K5jFBEGNnpGogZk?rlkey=yw6jpjhyohf1p7fmxskgxdqjt&st=hjnu7u5m&dl=0), along with all posterior draws, and simulation results, for users who prefer not to run the computations themselves.
